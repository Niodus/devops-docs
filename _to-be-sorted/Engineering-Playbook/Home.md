# Cloud Engineering Playbook

[[_TOC_]]

> **_Note_** - this wiki originated from [Microsoft's Code-With Engineering Playbook](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/), but has since been significantly modified to better suit SSP internal practices and culture.

An engineer working for a [Cloud Platform Team](Who-We-Are.md)...

- Has responsibilities to their team – mentor, coach, and lead.
- Knows their **playbook**. Follows their playbook. Fixes their playbook if it is broken. If they find a better playbook, they copy it. If somebody could use their playbook, they share it.
- Leads by example. Models the behaviors we desire both interpersonally and technically.
- Strives to understand how their work fits into a broader context and ensures the outcome.

This is our playbook. All contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a pull request to get involved.

## Why Have A Playbook

- To increase overall efficiency for team members and the whole team in general.
- To reduce the number of mistakes and avoid common pitfalls.
- To strive to be better engineers and learn from other people's shared experience.

## "The" Checklist

If you do nothing else follow the [Engineering Fundamentals Checklist](Fundamentals-Checklist.md)!

## Structure of a Sprint

The team follows Agile methodologies and the [structure of a sprint](./Continuous-Planning/Agile-Development/Sprint-Planning/Sprint-Structure.md) is a breakdown of the sections of the playbook according to the structure of an Agile sprint.

## General Guidance

- Keep the code quality bar high.
- Value quality and precision over ‘getting things done’.
- Work diligently on the one important thing.
- As a distributed team take time to share context via wiki, teams channels and backlog items.
- Make the simple thing work now. Build fewer features today, but ensure they work amazingly. Then add more features tomorrow.
- Avoid adding scope to a backlog item, instead add a new backlog item.
- Our goal is to ship incremental customer value and build on our successes.
- Keep backlog item details up to date to communicate the state of things with the rest of your team.
- Report product issues found and provide clear and repeatable engineering feedback!
- We all own our code and each one of us has an obligation to make all parts of the solution great.
