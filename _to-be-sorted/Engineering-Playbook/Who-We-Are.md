# Who We Are

Our team, CPT (Cloud Platform Team), works side by side with both delivery projects and operational teams to help them tackle their toughest technical problems both in the cloud and on-premises.

We meet customers where they are, work in the languages they use, with the frameworks they use, on the operating systems they use. We endeavour to maintain the core cloud platforms for Sussex and Surrey Police and our work covers a broad spectrum of things, such as coaching on Agile practices, maintain DevOps pipelines, writing IAC templates, working with SecOps team to minimize our security risks.

 We make pull requests on a number of different projects to add support for cloud platforms and/or improve existing implementations. We build frameworks and other tools to make it easier for Project (Dev) and BAU (Ops) teams to use cloud platforms. We source all the ideas for this work by maintaining very deep connections with these teams and then endeavour to share the best practices.
