# External Feedback

Various stakeholders can provide feedback to the working product during a project, beyond any formal
review and feedback sessions required by the organization. The frequency and method of collecting
feedback through reviews varies depending on the case, but a couple of good practices are:

## Best Practices for External Feedback

- Capture each review in the backlog as a separate user story.
- Standardize the tasks that implement this user story.
- Plan for a review user story per Epic / Feature in your backlog proactively.

### Tips on giving feedback

- **Give feedback after it’s asked for**. Chiming in during the developmental phase with suggestions and ideas will irritate the developers and collaborators.
- **Ask questions first**. Try to understand why things are this way and the thought process or the justification behind it.
- **Only relay the things under the receiver’s control**. Giving design feedback to the developer will not help in any way. In general, feedback is usually received by one person who classifies the received reviews and forwards them to the right collaborators.
- **Be concise and specific with examples**. While suggesting something, give proper reasoning and provide some examples for the same.
- **Give feedback that will improve the product**. Any feedback that you provide should be aimed at that.
- **End with a request for opinions**. It’s important to know how the receiver of the feedback feels about your ideas and suggestions.

_Example:_ Feedback like “the homepage doesn’t feel good” will not help the dev team. Instead say something like “the homepage doesn’t show information that’s relevant to me as a user.” The latter helps isolate the issue that the problem lies with the content or the way content is presented.

### Tips on receiving feedback

- **Listen to understand and not to reply**. Figure out the intent behind the feedback.
- **Be honest and open** while providing justifications for your decisions regarding the design.
- **A good reason** provided to the reviewer should precede refuting suggestions as to why their opinion and feedback will not work well.
- **Try to figure out why particular feedback is given**. Ask detailed questions in regard to that element of the product.
- **Propose off-the-top alternatives** and see if the reviewer is inclined to accept any of all them. It will help understand what is desired.
- **Follow up**. If there are a few suggestions that require a bit of research on your part, hit pause on that conversation and get back to that later.
