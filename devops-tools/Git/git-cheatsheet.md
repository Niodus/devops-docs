# Git Cheatsheet

The following pages contains some useful info and commands to help you get the most out of Git:

* As a simple starting point I have found that GitLab's version of a [CheatSheet](https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/git-cheat-sheet.pdf)is easy to understand.
* For a full Git reference see this [Git SCM Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).
