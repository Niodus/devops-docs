Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. It's a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests then run automatically. Automated tools are used to assert the new codeâ€™s correctness before integration.

The key goals of continuous integration are to find and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.

A source code version control system is the core of the CI process. The version control system is also supplemented with other checks like automated code quality tests, syntax style review tools, and more.
