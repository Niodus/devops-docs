Typically (but not exclusively) labelled with terms such as DevOps, DevSecOps, site reliability engineering, developer productivity engineering.
Activities include — but are not limited to:

- establishing secure and reliable software lifecycle principles and practices
- developing a supporting framework of methods, procedures, techniques, tools, and people with required skills, knowledge and competencies
- deploying and using this environment with the people and teams that are responsible for all systems and software life cycle engineering
- building repeatable and reliable capabilities through a process of trial, feedback, learning and continual evolution
- adapting working practices to the needs of specific products and services
- defining, controlling and improving software life cycle processes
- building in risk management, quality, security, privacy and safety
- maximising the automation of activities
- establishing software architecture and design principles to enable the desired life cycle processes
- focusing on mission, value and customers
- establishing a culture of collaboration, learning, knowledge management, adaptation and resilience
- adopting and integrating appropriate industry frameworks to guide improvements:
