## What is Backlog Management

Backlog management is the process by which the product owner (often in collaboration with others) adds, adjusts, grooms, and prioritizes backlog items within the backlog to make sure the most valuable product is shipped to customers. An oversized product backlog is a problem that indicates the team have either taken on too much work or they have other challenges that need addressing
