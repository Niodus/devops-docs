# Retrospectives

## What is an Agile retrospective?

An Agile retrospective is a meeting that's held at the end of an iteration in Agile software development. During the retrospective, the team reflects on what happened in the iteration and identifies actions for improvement going forward.  The aim of a retrospective is to:

1. Continually learn from our engagement, improving our ability to deliver value to our customers.
1. Involve everyone in the learning and improvement.
1. The dev team and *the larger org* learn from each engagement.

## Evidence and Measures

At the end of each milestone or engagement, the team will write up the results of their retrospective, including 1-3 proposed changes or experiments. Owners will be assigned to each item, to make sure that retrospection leads to action, when desired.

Proposed changes coming out of iteration retrospectives should be tracked as tasks or bugs in the project backlog.

## General Guidance

This [*Agile playbook by Atlassian*](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective) provides a clear script for conducting retrospectives. Every retrospective should follow some version of the script, depending on the length of the retrospective. The basic script is:

1. Prep.
1. Set the stage.
1. What we did well.
1. What we can do better .
1. Actions.
1. Close the retrospective.

Within that script, the facilitator can make choices with regard to which activities to use for each element.  If it suits your team you can even run different variations of a retrospective to suit different use cases such as:

### Project or Milestone Retrospective

These are the most intense retrospectives, in that they cover more project working time and should be the strictest with regard to following the ceremony described in the retrospective book. The goal of most project or milestone retrospectives is to identify proposed changes that the team might try in the next project. Teams should cover the overall project or milestone, including the development phase, how the on-site hack went, how well the customer engagement team did, how well the wrap up activities went, how well the whole project team worked together, etc.

A project or milestone retrospective will usually take **3-4 hours**, depending on how long or complex the milestone was and how many people are involved in the retrospective

It is recommended that due to the complexity of project level milestones it is recommended that you ensure you have an experienced facilitator to run this retrospective.

### Iteration Retrospective

Iteration reviews should follow the ceremony of the retrospective script, but using less time and fewer activities than the project or milestone retrospective. Iteration (sprint) retrospectives will focus more on execution and implementation details and how the team can improve execution for future iterations.

An iteration retrospective will usually take **1-2 hours**.

Usually, the Process Lead or Dev Lead will conduct the first one or two iteration retrospectives. After that, it's good for the team to take turns.

### Single-Day Iteration Retrospective

This variation assumes that the team is running an iteration per day, which is common in code-with engagements or hacks that have higher levels of uncertainty. In a single-day sprint, the team runs a 15-30 minute planning session for the day, conducts at least one standup (frequently immediately after lunch), and has a short demo, followed by a short retrospective at the end of the day.

A single-day iteration retrospective will usually take **15-30 minutes**.

### Recommended Activity Recipes

Below are recommended commendations of activities to use in the slots above.

### Tough Project Milestone

Typically used when you have just had a tough period and to give participants a chance to vent before getting into the more analytical parts of the retrospective.
