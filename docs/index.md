## Welcome Aboard

Welcome to my DevOps page. My name is Scott McCarthy and I am a professional DevOps engineer.

I love to help people with their technology challenges, particularly in the DevOps space so decided the best way I can help is to capture my knowledge in the form of a Wiki.

If you would like to know more about me, then please see my [LinkedIn page Bio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-mccarthy-7747a820/)

## Why Another DevOps Site?

Why; simply put I have been working in a software integration role since 2007 (so even before it was labelled DevOps) and up till this point I have mostly been reading and consuming other people work. There are so many great documents and articles out there on the internet, I have not really found the need to write anything of substance.. and then I came across the [Microsoft CSE teams Github page](https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook) where they have captured all of their teams working practices and published them as an open-source engineering playbook.

So firstly a big shout out to the Microsoft CSE for inspiring me to actually start to capture my own knowledge and experiences in the form of this DevOps Docs site.

## Site Structure

I will be aiming to cover the following sections/topics on this site

| Topic                                                 | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Fundamentals](the-basics.md)          | For those just getting starting in the DevOps space.                                                                         |
| [Best Practices](best-practices.md) | A comprehensive guide on DevOps best practices                                                                               |
| [Tools](tools.md)                      | As or when I come across specific information on the tooling that I typically use I will add it to this section              |
| [Learning](learning.md)             | A Learning section to help with study guides that I Create, plus any useful info I find that will help people with learning. |
