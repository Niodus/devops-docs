# Welcome

## Welcome Aboard

Welcome to my DevOps wiki page. My name is Scott McCarthy and I am a professional DevOps engineer.

I love to help people with their technology challenges, particularly in the DevOps space so decided the best way I can help is to capture my knowledge in the form of a Wiki.

If you would like to know more about me, then please see my [LinkedIn page Bio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-m-7747a820)
