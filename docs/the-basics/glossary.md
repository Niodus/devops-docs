Similar to incremental rollout, it is where a small portion of the user base is updated to a new version first.  THis subset, the canaries, then serve as the proverbial "canary in the coal mine".  If something goes wrong then a release is rolled back and only a small subset of the users are impacted. |

| Configuration Management | CM is a systems engineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a products performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout its life. |
| Conformance Test | The purpose of the test is to determine if an EUT complies to a standard. |
| Constraint | Limitation or restriction; something that constrains.  See also bottleneck |
