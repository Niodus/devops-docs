This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market. How DevOps Works \u00b6 Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer \u201csiloed.\u201d Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function. In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with development and operations and throughout the application lifecycle. When security is the focus of everyone on a DevOps team, this is sometimes referred to as DevSecOps.These teams use practices to automate processes that historically have been manual and slow. They use a technology stack and tooling which helps them operate and evolve applications quickly and reliably. These tools also help engineers independently accomplish tasks (for example, deploying code or provisioning infrastructure) that normally would have required help from other teams, and this further increases a team\u2019s velocity. Benefits of DevOps \u00b6 Speed - Move at a high velocity so you can innovate for customers faster, adapt to changing markets better, and grow more efficiently at driving business results. The DevOps model enables your developers and operations teams to achieve these results. For example, micro-services continuous delivery lets teams take ownership of services and then release updates to them quicker. Rapid Delivery - Increase the frequency and pace of releases so you can innovate and improve your product faster. The quicker you can release new features and fix bugs, the faster you can respond to your customers\u2019 needs and build a competitive advantage. and Continuous integrations are practices that automate the software release process, from build to deploy. Reliability - Ensure the quality of application updates and infrastructure changes so you can reliably deliver at a more rapid pace while maintaining a positive experience for end-users. Use practices like and to test that each change is continuous integration continuous delivery functional and safe. practices help you stay informed of performance in real-time. Scale - Operate and manage your infrastructure and development processes at scale. Automation and consistency help you manage complex or changing systems efficiently and with reduced risk. For example, helps you manage your development, testing, and infrastructure as code production environments in a repeatable and more efficient manner. Improved Collaboration - Build more effective teams under a DevOps cultural model, which emphasizes values such as ownership and accountability. Developers and operations teams closely, share many responsibilities and combine their workflows. This reduces inefficiencies and saves time (e.g. reduced handover periods between developers and operations, writing code that takes into account the environment in which it is run). Security - Move quickly while retaining control and preserving compliance. You can adopt a DevOps model without sacrificing security by using automated compliance policies, fine-grained controls, and configuration management techniques. For example, using infrastructure as code and you can define and then track compliance at scale. Why DevOps Matters \u00b6 Software and the Internet have transformed the world and its industries, from shopping to entertainment to banking. Software no longer merely supports a business; rather it becomes an integral component of every part of a business. Companies interact with their customers through software delivered as online services or applications and on all sorts of devices. They also use software to increase operational efficiencies by transforming every part of the value chain, such as logistics, communications, and operations. In a similar way that physical goods companies transformed how they design, build, and deliver products using industrial automation throughout the 20th century, companies in today\u2019s world must transform how they build and deliver software.

A big bang release would follow months of design, development and if you are lucky testing. The problem with such long term plans are that they tend to become obsolete very quickly. They also delay any return of investment to when the application or service will be released. Also requirements are rarely clear at the start of a project and late feedback can cause a lot of money to be wasted. Continuous planning advocates for more flexibility on the scope of the deliverable, trying to keep the cost of projects fixed and providing a faster return of investment by shipping high-value features in iterations first. At the heart of all continuous improvement is the Deming's Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. the key steps in this cycle are: Plan \u2013 determine the critical success factors for the process you are trying to improve, establish measurements that will assess your performance in these key result areas, and establish targets against which actual performance will be compared. Do \u2013 execute the process which you are measuring and capture the data which allows you to assess the performance of that process Check \u2013 compare actual performance with the target previously established and understand the reasons for variances Act \u2013 implement the actions necessary to make improvements This feeds the different phases of development and operations. Also addressing changes and evolutions according to a continuous improvement process, based on continuous feedback. It\u2019s also important that Business and Management teams get the appropriate training on tools and metrics in order to have enough visibility of the project\u2019s development. Continuous Planning will enable your team to provide a constant flow of functionalities by having a continuously updated plan in place, adjusted to the business requirements. Continuous Integration will implement the plan and provide feedback on development speed to ensure a realistic plan is in place.

An oversized product backlog is a problem that indicates the team have either taken on too much work or they have other challenges that need addressing. Backlog management can be broken down into the following sub-sections: Backlog Refinement Minimal Slices External Feedback Backlog Refinement \u00b6 Goals \u00b6 What are the intended outcomes of the ceremonies? Backlog refinement is when the product owner and some, or all, of the rest of the team review items on the backlog to ensure the backlog contains the appropriate items, that they are prioritized, and that the items at the top of the backlog are ready for development. This activity occurs on a regular basis and may be an officially scheduled meeting or an ongoing activity. Participation \u00b6 What members of the team should participate? Ideally all the team members could participate. This is an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog items. Impact \u00b6 What positive impact has been observed as a result of this practice? The intent of backlog refinement is to ensure that the backlog keeps updating with items that are appropriate to their priority, i.e. higher priority items are with more details than lower priority ones. Also, it is important that at any time there are enough user stories ready for planning in the next or even, where reasonable, the next two or three iterations but not too much further. Measures \u00b6 How might one measure the impact of this ceremony positive or negative? The expected outcome from the backlog refinement is all the team members are on the same page of what they are going to implement in the next or next few iterations with priority. A positive outcome of refinement is one where each backlog item can reasonably be \u201cdone\u201d within the sprint time. Product backlog items that can be \u201cdone\u201d by the development team within one sprint are deemed \u201cready\u201d for selection in a sprint planning. Facilitation Guidance \u00b6 How might one go about running the ceremony? Is there a general pattern that the ceremony should follow? Product Owner: presents the ordered backlog and backlog list they'd like in the next iteration. Process Lead: ensure the timebox. Team members: ask questions and request additional details on the backlog if needed. Make sure that the team does not focus on how to implement the items. Instead, the Product Owner and Team discuss the goals and context for these high - priority items on the Product Backlog, providing the Team with insight into the Product Owner\u2019s thinking. Minimalism Slices \u00b6 Minimalism Slices, simply refers to the practice of breaking down pieces of work so they can be ackomlished in a reasonable time frame. Split your work item into small chunks that are contributed in incremental commits. Contribute your chunks frequently. Follow an iterative approach by regularly providing updates and changes to the team. This allows for instant feedback and early issue discovery and ensures you are developing in the right direction, both technically and functionally. Do NOT work independently on your task without providing any updates to your team. Example of a Bad approach \u00b6 After six weeks of work you created PR with all required functionality, including portal UI (build settings), backend REST API (UWP build functionality), telemetry, unit and integration tests, etc. Example of a Good approach \u00b6 You divided your feature into smaller user stories (which in turn were divided into multiple tasks) and started working on them one by one: As a user I can successfully build UWP apps using current service As a user I can see telemetry when building the apps As a user I have the ability to select build configuration (debug, release) As a user I have the ability to select target platform (arm, x86, x64) ... You also divided your stories into smaller tasks and sent PRs based on those tasks. E.g. you have the following tasks for the first user story above: Enable UWP platform on backend Add build button to the UI (build first solution file found) Add select solution file dropdown to the UI Implement unit tests Implement integration tests to verify build succeeded Update documentation ... External Feedback \u00b6 Various stakeholders can provide feedback to the working product during a project, beyond any formal review and feedback sessions required by the organization. The frequency and method of collecting feedback through reviews varies depending on the case, but a couple of good practices are: Best Practices for External Feedback \u00b6 Capture each review in the backlog as a separate user story. Standardize the tasks that implement this user story. Plan for a review user story per Epic / Feature in your backlog proactively. Tips on giving feedback \u00b6 Give feedback after it\u2019s asked for . Chiming in during the developmental phase with suggestions and ideas will irritate the developers and collaborators. Ask questions first . Try to understand why things are this way and the thought process or the justification behind it. Only relay the things under the receiver\u2019s control . Giving design feedback to the developer will not help in any way. In general, feedback is usually received by one person who classifies the received reviews and forwards them to the right collaborators. Be concise and specific with examples . While suggesting something, give proper reasoning and provide some examples for the same. Give feedback that will improve the product . Any feedback that you provide should be aimed at that. End with a request for opinions . It\u2019s important to know how the receiver of the feedback feels about your ideas and suggestions. Example: Feedback like \u201cthe homepage doesn\u2019t feel good\u201d will not help the dev team. Instead say something like \u201cthe homepage doesn\u2019t show information that\u2019s relevant to me as a user.\u201d The latter helps isolate the issue that the problem lies with the content or the way content is presented. Tips on receiving feedback \u00b6 Listen to understand and not to reply . Figure out the intent behind the feedback. Be honest and open while providing justifications for your decisions regarding the design. A good reason provided to the reviewer should precede refuting suggestions as to why their opinion and feedback will not work well. Try to figure out why particular feedback is given . Ask detailed questions in regard to that element of the product. Propose off-the-top alternatives and see if the reviewer is inclined to accept any of all them. It will help understand what is desired. Follow up . If there are a few suggestions that require a bit of research on your part, hit pause on that conversation and get back to that later.

There are two common patterns we use for collaboration: Pairing and swarming. Pair programming (\u201cpairing\u201d) - two software engineers assigned to, and working on, one shared story at a time during the sprint. The Dev Lead assigns a user story to two engineers -- one primary engineer (story owner) and one secondary engineer (pairing assignee). The definition aligns with the Agile Alliance\u2019s definition . Swarm programming (\u201cswarming\u201d) - three or more software engineers collaborating on a high-priority item to bring it to completion. How to pair program \u00b6 As mentioned, every story is intentionally assigned to a pair. The pairing assignee may be in the process of up-skilling, nevertheless, they are equal partners in the development effort. Below are some general guidelines for pairing: Upon assignment of the story/product backlog item (PBI), the pair needs to be deliberate about defining how to work together and have a firm definition of the work to be completed. This information should be expressed clearly in the story\u2019s description and acceptance criteria. The expectations about this need to be communicated and agreed upon by both engineers and should be done prior to any actual working sessions. The story owner and pairing assignee do not merely split the work up and sync regularly \u2013 they actively work together on the same tasks, and might share their screens via a Teams online session. Collaborative tools like VS Live Share can be preferable to sharing screens. Not all collaboration needs to be screen-share based. During the collaborative sessions, one engineer provides the development environment while the other actively views and comments verbally. Engineers trade places often from one session to the next so that everyone has time in control of the keyboard. Engineers leverage feature branches for the collaboration during the development of each story to have small Pull Requests (PRs) (as opposed to a single giant PR) at the end of the sprint. Code is committed to the repository by both members of the assigned pair where and when it makes sense as tasks were completed. The pairing assignee is the voice representing the pair during the daily standup while being supported by the story owner. Having the names of both individuals (owner and pair assignee) visible on the PBI can be helpful during sprint ceremonies and lead to greater accountability by the pairing assignee. Why pair programming helps collaboration \u00b6 Pair programming helps collaboration because both engineers share equal responsibility for bringing the story to completion. This is a mutually beneficial exercise because, while the story owner often has more experience to lean on, the pairing assignee brings a fresh view that is unclouded by repetition. Some other benefits include: Fewer defects and increased accountability. Having two sets of eyes allows the engineers more opportunity to catch errors and to remember often-overlooked tasks such as writing unit and integration tests. Pairing allows engineers with different experience and expertise to learn from one another by collaborating and receiving feedback in real-time. Instead of having an engineer work alone on a task for long hours and hit an isolation breaking point, pairing allows the pair to check in with one another. Even something as simple as describing the problem out loud can help uncover issues or bugs in the code. Pairing can help brainstorming as well as validating details such as making the variable names consistent. When to swarm program \u00b6 It is important to know that not every PBI needs to use swarming. Some sprints may not even warrant swarming at all. Swarm when: The work is complex enough to have collective minds collaborating (not because the quantity of work is more than what would be completed in one sprint). The task that the swarm works on has become (or is in imminent danger of becoming) a blocker to other stories. An unknown is discovered that needs a collaborative effort to form a decision on how to move forward. The collective knowledge and expertise help move the story forward more quickly and ultimately produced better quality code. A conflict or unresolved difference of opinion arises during a pairing session. Promote the work to become a swarming session to help resolve the conflict. How to swarm program \u00b6 As soon the pair finds out that the PBI will warrant swarming, the pair brings it up to the rest of the team (via parking lot during stand-up or asynchronously). Members of the team agree or volunteer to assist. The story owner (or pairing assignee) sends Teams call invite to the interested parties. This allows the swarm to have dedicated focus time by blocking time in calendars. During a swarming session, an engineer can branch out if there is something that needs to be handled while the swarm tackles the main problem at hand, then reconnects and reports back. This allows the swarm to focus on a core aspect and to be all on the same page. The Teams call is repeated until resolution is found or alternative path forward is formulated. Why swarm programming helps collaboration \u00b6 Swarming allows the collective knowledge and expertise of the team to come together in a focused and unified way. Not only does swarming help close out the item faster, but it also helps the team understand each other\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. Allows the team to build a higher level of trust and work as a cohesive unit. When to decide to swarm, pair, and/or split \u00b6 While a lot of time can be spent on pair programming, it does make sense to split the work when folks understand how the work will be carried out, and the work to be done is largely prescriptive. Once the story has been jointly tasked out by both engineers, the engineers may choose to tackle some tasks separately and then combine the work together at the end. Pair programming is more helpful when the engineers do not have perfect clarity about what is needed to be done or how it can be done. Swarming is done when the two engineers assigned to the story need an additional sounding board or need expertise that other team members could provide. Benefits of increased collaboration \u00b6 Knowledge sharing and bringing customer engineers together in a \u2018code-with\u2019 manner is an important aspect of any engagement. This grows both our customers\u2019 and our team\u2019s capability to build on Azure. We are responsible for demonstrating engineering fundamentals and leaving the customer in a better place after we disengage. This can only happen if we collaborate and engage together as a team.

During the retrospective, the team reflects on what happened in the iteration and identifies actions for improvement going forward. The aim of a retrospective is to: Continually learn from our engagement, improving our ability to deliver value to our customers. Involve everyone in the learning and improvement. The dev team and the larger org learn from each engagement. Evidence and Measures \u00b6 At the end of each milestone or engagement, the team will write up the results of their retrospective, including 1-3 proposed changes or experiments. Owners will be assigned to each item, to make sure that retrospection leads to action, when desired. Proposed changes coming out of iteration retrospectives should be tracked as tasks or bugs in the project backlog. General Guidance \u00b6 This Agile playbook by Atlassian provides a clear script for conducting retrospectives. Every retrospective should follow some version of the script, depending on the length of the retrospective. The basic script is: Prep. Set the stage. What we did well. What we can do better . Actions. Close the retrospective. Within that script, the facilitator can make choices with regard to which activities to use for each element. If it suits your team you can even run different variations of a retrospective to suit different use cases such as: Project or Milestone Retrospective \u00b6 These are the most intense retrospectives, in that they cover more project working time and should be the strictest with regard to following the ceremony described in the retrospective book. The goal of most project or milestone retrospectives is to identify proposed changes that the team might try in the next project. Teams should cover the overall project or milestone, including the development phase, how the on-site hack went, how well the customer engagement team did, how well the wrap up activities went, how well the whole project team worked together, etc. A project or milestone retrospective will usually take 3-4 hours , depending on how long or complex the milestone was and how many people are involved in the retrospective It is recommended that due to the complexity of project level milestones it is recommended that you ensure you have an experienced facilitator to run this retrospective. Iteration Retrospective \u00b6 Iteration reviews should follow the ceremony of the retrospective script, but using less time and fewer activities than the project or milestone retrospective. Iteration (sprint) retrospectives will focus more on execution and implementation details and how the team can improve execution for future iterations. An iteration retrospective will usually take 1-2 hours . Usually, the Process Lead or Dev Lead will conduct the first one or two iteration retrospectives. After that, it's good for the team to take turns. Single-Day Iteration Retrospective \u00b6 This variation assumes that the team is running an iteration per day, which is common in code-with engagements or hacks that have higher levels of uncertainty. In a single-day sprint, the team runs a 15-30 minute planning session for the day, conducts at least one standup (frequently immediately after lunch), and has a short demo, followed by a short retrospective at the end of the day.

In Scrum, we consider a team being too big when going over 10-12 individuals. This should be decided on a case by case basis. If the project is set up in multiple work streams that contain a fixed group of people and a common stand-up meeting is slowing down productivity: scrum of scrums should be considered. The team would identify the different subgroups that would act as a separate scrum teams with their own backlog, board and stand-up . Goals \u00b6 The goal of the scrum of scrums ceremony is to give sub-teams the agility they need while not loosing visibility and coordination. It also helps to ensure that the sub-teams are achieving their sprint goals, and they are going in the right direction to achieve the overall project goal. The scrum of scrums ceremony happens every day and can be seen as a regular stand-up: What was done the day before by the sub-team. What will be done today by the sub-team. What are blockers or other issues for the sub-team. What are the blockers or issues that may impact other sub-teams. The outcome of the meeting will result in a list of impediments related to coordination of the whole project. Solutions could be: agreeing on interfaces between teams, discussing architecture changes, evolving responsibility boundaries, etc. This list of impediments is usually managed in a separate backlog but does not have to. Participation \u00b6 The common guideline is to have on average one person per sub-team to participate in the scrum of scrums. Ideally, the Process Lead of each sub-team would represent them in this ceremony. In some instances, the representative for the day is selected at the end of each sub-team daily stand-up and could change every day. In practice, having a fixed representative tends to be more efficient in the long term. Impact \u00b6 This practice is helpful in cases of longer projects and with a larger scope, requiring more people. When having more people, it is usually easier to divide the project in sub-teams. Having a daily scrum of scrums improves communication, lowers the risk of integration issues and increases the project chances of success. When choosing to implement Scrum of Scrums, you need to keep in mind that some team members will have additional meetings to coordinate and participate in. Also: all team members for each sub-team need to be updated on the decisions at a later point to ensure a good flow of information. Measures \u00b6 The easiest way to measure the impact is by tracking the time to resolve issues in the scrum of scrums backlog. You can also track issues reported during the retrospective related to global coordination (is it well done? can it be improved?).

In this ceremony, each contributor in the Development Team will answer three simple project questions and an optional social question. This will repeat until each contributor has answered the following questions. What did you work on yesterday that contributes to meet the sprint goal? What are you working on today that will contribute to meet the sprint goal? Do you have any impediments/blockers or need any help? (defer discussion / resolution to \"the parking lot\", described below) An optional social question , e.g. \"would you rather see the past or the future?\" During the stand-up, additional discussions may arise. Make sure that someone adds them to the parking lot for after meeting discussion. After that point, the stand-up is concluded. As a good practice, the items in the parking lot take place right after the stand-up. However, you can opt to discuss the parking lot items at another time before the next stand-up. The participation in the parking lot discussion is optional for all members except those explicitly needed for discussion of the issues raised. The term parking lot refers to a bucket of comments, concerns, or questions that will be discussed and/or addressed at a later point with potentially fewer contributors. This is part of a strategy to avoid letting the discussion in a meeting shift to a subject that is not aligned with the meeting goals and/or decisions. Goals \u00b6 Bring awareness of the progress done towards the sprint goal, and the sprint backlog. Surface any impediments to one or more team members' contributions. Maintain contact between remote team members to reduce social barriers to collaboration. Participation \u00b6 The entire team should attend the stand-up. Anyone that worked on a task towards the sprint work should answer the three questions. It would be up to the team to decide if they would like updates from members that are not directly working against sprint task work (i.e. Product Owners and Program Managers). ScrumMaster (Required) Product Owner (Optional) Program Manager (Required) Dev Lead + Contributors (Required) Impact \u00b6 Team members get a clear understanding of what development tasks are going on within the team which helps with collaboration. It also provides a time to address any challenges or blockers that may be stopping specific tasks from being completed, therefore helping with velocity. Measures \u00b6 Both stand-up length and time to start are important as the stand-up has to be seen as a reliable and efficient meeting that facilitates communication of information versus unnecessary overhead. Stand-up Length \u00b6 While the length can depend on the team size, if everyone is sticking to one line answers to the key questions, it should be fairly easy to conclude within 5-10 minutes. Example (team size == ~8) \u00b6 1-5 min = Excellent 5-10 min = Great 10-15 min = Good 15+ min = Needs Improvement Time to Start \u00b6 How long after the scheduled start time did contributors begin providing updates? 0-1 min = Excellent 1-3 min = Great 3-5 min = Good 5+ min = Needs Improvement New Tasks Created After Stand-up \u00b6 How many tasks are being generated after the stand-up that didn't exist before? This can indicate how much unplanned work is being done. If creating new tasks after stand-up becomes routine (especially for the same story), this could indicate the story is at higher risk of not being completed. It could also indicate a shift in focus to an unplanned objective. Facilitation Guidance \u00b6 The ScrumMaster should facilitate the stand-up meeting. Speak to Tasks \u00b6 When answering what was worked on and what will be worked on, refer directly to tasks. This has two benefits: The answer will naturally be short (e.g. \"I finished task 114 yesterday; which was to update the build of the api container image. I will be starting on task 115 today; which is to update the release pipeline for the same container image.\"). Unplanned work will be easily identifiable. If the person is unable to refer to a task, that typically indicates they are working on something unplanned or out of scope for the sprint (e.g. Yesterday, I was attempting to optimize some unit tests from last sprint to run faster). If a contributor is not working on an existing sprint task they need to either create a new task under an existing sprint story to reflect that work, or defer that work until it's scheduled for a later sprint. If a contributor provides an update without referring to a task, ask the contributor which task. Parking Lot Discussion Items \u00b6 As contributors are answering the questions, if another contributor has a question or issue to share, they should reserve until after all contributors have finished answering. Once each member has answered all questions, the Process Lead should open up the floor to anyone who may have an open question or unresolved issue to share. This portion of the ceremony is often referred to as the \"Parking Lot\". Parking lot discussions are optional for participants. Ensure discussion leaders call out necessary parties for their discussion points upfront, allowing those not needed to leave the meeting. Social question \u00b6 Teams are frequently geographically distributed and include members who have not worked on projects together previously. Social interactions facilitate the development of trust between team members and lower the barriers to collaboration. A social question-of-the-day that has a one-sentence answer contributes to trust development over the course of many stand-ups, with a minimal additional time commitment. The answer to the social question should be brief and follow the project questions answer. The facilitator may choose the social question or take a suggestion from the room. Description of what makes a good question, and a list of starter questions are available within the social question page. Start On Time \u00b6 Make a best effort to begin answering the questions as close to the scheduled start time as possible. Try not to waste time upfront on chit-chat or waiting on all team members to join. This can extend the meeting time significantly. Starting immediately will help ensure stand-ups remain effective and useful over time. Same Time Every weekday \u00b6 Stand-up should be held at the same time each weekday. The meeting time should be mutually agreed-upon by the contributors, and should take into consideration time zones, working schedules, and other factors so that every team member can reasonably participate. Multiple Time zones \u00b6 For team members distributed across time zones, consider scheduling the stand-up at the best convenient time within the time zone that has the most team members. Tip : Whenever you have a large difference between the time zones, consider scheduling the stand up in such a way it does not occur at an inconvenient time for the same time zone every day. Contributors Unable to Attend (async updates) \u00b6 If a contributor knows that they will have to miss the stand-up, ask them to provide their answers to the questions in written form before the stand-up. They could provide these over a shared Teams channel or email to the team. The Process Lead can then read the answers during the stand-up. Reading the update aloud during the stand-up will ensure the answers are communicated to the team. Remote Located Team Members \u00b6 If any team member is working remotely, plan to run stand-ups through conference calls. Ask the team members to keep the camera on as much as possible so that they can see each other when speaking against the questions. Tip : In order to keep the remote stand-up as efficient, in a good pace and with the collective sense as it is in a physically located stand-up, you can agree on applying a \"pick the next one approach\" in which the current contributor to speak picks the next in a loop until everyone with contributions had answered the questions.

Over time, they get a sense for how their team approaches the stories, and the effort that will be required to complete each story. With a few successful sprints completed, the team can start to see patterns of success and where the team has had failures. The team can start to look at their velocity against their estimates and begin to predict with greater accuracy what effort will be needed to complete the next story. If the makeup of the team is regularly changing, the process of estimation becomes challenging as the patterns that drive the estimation process also change. Initially, it will take three to five or more sprints to find a good rhythm to the team estimations. When the team changes to a new project or a team is reorganized to join with another team, the estimation model is essentially reset, and a new baseline must be formed. Before beginning the estimation process, the team should be clear what the goal of the user story is. This means that the work to be done should be clear, and the acceptance criteria is agreed on by the team members that are doing estimation. If the story is not ready to be handed off to a developer to start working on, it is not ready for estimation. Sizing \u00b6 There are many ways to size stories. This is usually where teams get hung up on finding the balance between sizing that feel \"willy-nilly\" and accurately estimating the hours to complete the work. It is helpful to remember that this exercise is to accurately determine what work can be completed in the sprint...not a precise time allocation for the work to be complete. In the beginning, to determine sizing, the team will generally pick two or three stories that reflect a known amount of work of varying size. Usually, a simple, an average, and a complex story will work best. A simple story is one that can be completed by a single developer in a time that is relatively short compared to the length of the sprint. For example, if your team is running weeklong sprints, a simple story might be able to be completed in a day, an average story might be two days, and a complex story might take the entire sprint. The key is that there is consensus on the team for what the relative sizes reflect. After a baseline is agreed upon, the planning team will estimate each story that is ready for development and will be given a relative sizing based on the sizing agreed to by the team. Examples of estimating approaches are given below. As the team works together, they will gain more experience about how the team estimates the size stories. There will be more stories to help gauge the relative size of the stories being estimated. This will tend to make the estimates more accurate over time. As the team works together they will have better data to know how much work can be committed to for the next sprint. Planning Poker \u00b6 Possibly the most popular approach to sizing is called Planning Poker. This approach assigns sizing based on the fibonacci numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and 21. This can be done with something as low tech as holding up fingers to online tools that allow teams to remotely vote. Co-located teams can even choose to purchase playing cards that reflect the fibonacci numbers and distribute the cards during the estimating time. Online tools like Azure DevOps have extensions that can be installed that help remote team members to do estimating effectively. One example of this is the \"Estimate\" extension by Microsoft DevLabs that ties planning poker directly to the stories and will update \"Story Points\" field in the user story. Depending on how granular the team wants the numbers, the team should focus not on time but on relative work to be done. If you find that your team is saying \"this should take one day, so it is an 8\" you will soon lose the value of the estimation exercise. Rather, you should think \"this story is more difficult than that story\". So when the team is estimating a story, the team can ask \"How difficult is this story compared to the work we did last sprint that was a 5?\" Less difficult maybe it's a 2 or 3. More difficult it's an 8 or three times as difficult...13. When you go beyond 21 you may want to ask if the story can be broken down into smaller chunks. T-Shirt Sizes \u00b6 When using numbers, teams start to over-analyze what the points should be, or they try to begin to correlate points to hours on the clock. Teams start to pad their estimates so they can justify their work with their time sheet. When you see this start to happen, it may be time to remind the team this is about relative sizing not about hours to complete the work. One way to do this is to switch to T-Shirt sizing. With this approach you have extra small, small, medium, large, extra-large, and double extra-large. When you remove the correlation to numbers, the team remembers that their goal is only to determine how difficult the work is before committing to the work to be done. It also gives the product owner visibility that what was perceived as a simple task may be more costly and thus less desirable than a couple of other features of a smaller size. Another benefit of using a less granular approach is that the team won't spend so much time trying to come to agreement on the precise measurement of the work. Decisions on medium or large are easier than deciding a work item is 5 or 8 points. That said this will also put the agile team leader in the position of converting sizes into numeric values for the purpose of charting and tracking velocity over time. Estimation in Planning \u00b6 As the team continues the exercise of estimating in the planning meeting, it should be viewed as an exercise in relative sizing of the work. Comparing the expected work to work that has already been done is helpful for the team to understand how they view the complexity of the work. Estimation can be done at any time with the consensus of the team and doesn't always have to be done during the sprint planning. It may be helpful to the product owner to understand the relative effort for the stories in order to prioritize the work. If the Product Owners sees that one feature that they highly value, might not be as valuable when they see that three other features that get pushed out because of that one story's complexity. In the planning meeting, the team looks at the prioritized items that are ready for development. The team should work through the items in priority making sure that if there is already an estimate the team still agrees with the estimate. Finally, the team should estimate how many points the team can deliver in the sprint and then make a commitment for the sprint. During the sprint, the team takes the highest priority items off of the backlog and works on them to completion. At the end of the sprint, the team reports the number of story points completed during the sprint. The agile coordinator should track this information so that over time, the team can work to get better at estimating the points that each story requires as well as how many points can be delivered in a given sprint. Relative Mass \u00b6 If there are a lot of stories to be estimated, the team can be overwhelmed doing this all at once, and the process can be long and unproductive. However, because the stories are estimated relative to each other, it may be easier to do a relative mass estimation. For each story, either a card or a sticky note is created. The first card is read and then placed in the center of the table or board. Then, as each card is read, the team asks \"Is this easier or harder that that card?\", and it is placed in either lower or higher position than the story that already exist on the table. This continues with each card being placed in a line of difficulty from easiest to most difficult until all stories are placed. Finally, the team then finds the \"breaks\" that represent their relative sizing model and record the estimation for each of the cards in that grouping. When working with remote teams this can be done with a shared story board, or a list where the work items can be placed in an ordered ranking. Again, starting with the top story, each subsequent story is placed higher or lower in the list based on the relative mass of the story.","title":"Estimation"},{"location":"best-practices/continuous-planning/agile-development/sprint-planning/estimation.html#sizing","text":"There are many ways to size stories. This is usually where teams get hung up on finding the balance between sizing that feel \"willy-nilly\" and accurately estimating the hours to complete the work. It is helpful to remember that this exercise is to accurately determine what work can be completed in the sprint...not a precise time allocation for the work to be complete. In the beginning, to determine sizing, the team will generally pick two or three stories that reflect a known amount of work of varying size. Usually, a simple, an average, and a complex story will work best. A simple story is one that can be completed by a single developer in a time that is relatively short compared to the length of the sprint. For example, if your team is running weeklong sprints, a simple story might be able to be completed in a day, an average story might be two days, and a complex story might take the entire sprint. The key is that there is consensus on the team for what the relative sizes reflect. After a baseline is agreed upon, the planning team will estimate each story that is ready for development and will be given a relative sizing based on the sizing agreed to by the team. Examples of estimating approaches are given below. As the team works together, they will gain more experience about how the team estimates the size stories. There will be more stories to help gauge the relative size of the stories being estimated. This will tend to make the estimates more accurate over time. As the team works together they will have better data to know how much work can be committed to for the next sprint.","title":"Sizing"},{"location":"best-practices/continuous-planning/agile-development/sprint-planning/estimation.html#planning-poker","text":"Possibly the most popular approach to sizing is called Planning Poker. This approach assigns sizing based on the fibonacci numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and 21. This can be done with something as low tech as holding up fingers to online tools that allow teams to remotely vote. Co-located teams can even choose to purchase playing cards that reflect the fibonacci numbers and distribute the cards during the estimating time. Online tools like Azure DevOps have extensions that can be installed that help remote team members to do estimating effectively. One example of this is the \"Estimate\" extension by Microsoft DevLabs that ties planning poker directly to the stories and will update \"Story Points\" field in the user story. Depending on how granular the team wants the numbers, the team should focus not on time but on relative work to be done. If you find that your team is saying \"this should take one day, so it is an 8\" you will soon lose the value of the estimation exercise. Rather, you should think \"this story is more difficult than that story\". So when the team is estimating a story, the team can ask \"How difficult is this story compared to the work we did last sprint that was a 5?\" Less difficult maybe it's a 2 or 3. More difficult it's an 8 or three times as difficult...13. When you go beyond 21 you may want to ask if the story can be broken down into smaller chunks.","title":"Planning Poker"},{"location":"best-practices/continuous-planning/agile-development/sprint-planning/estimation.html#t-shirt-sizes","text":"When using numbers, teams start to over-analyze what the points should be, or they try to begin to correlate points to hours on the clock. Teams start to pad their estimates so they can justify their work with their time sheet. When you see this start to happen, it may be time to remind the team this is about relative sizing not about hours to complete the work. One way to do this is to switch to T-Shirt sizing. With this approach you have extra small, small, medium, large, extra-large, and double extra-large. When you remove the correlation to numbers, the team remembers that their goal is only to determine how difficult the work is before committing to the work to be done. It also gives the product owner visibility that what was perceived as a simple task may be more costly and thus less desirable than a couple of other features of a smaller size. Another benefit of using a less granular approach is that the team won't spend so much time trying to come to agreement on the precise measurement of the work. Decisions on medium or large are easier than deciding a work item is 5 or 8 points. That said this will also put the agile team leader in the position of converting sizes into numeric values for the purpose of charting and tracking velocity over time.","title":"T-Shirt Sizes"},{"location":"best-practices/continuous-planning/agile-development/sprint-planning/estimation.html#estimation-in-planning","text":"As the team continues the exercise of estimating in the planning meeting, it should be viewed as an exercise in relative sizing of the work. Comparing the expected work to work that has already been done is helpful for the team to understand how they view the complexity of the work. Estimation can be done at any time with the consensus of the team and doesn't always have to be done during the sprint planning. It may be helpful to the product owner to understand the relative effort for the stories in order to prioritize the work. If the Product Owners sees that one feature that they highly value, might not be as valuable when they see that three other features that get pushed out because of that one story's complexity. In the planning meeting, the team looks at the prioritized items that are ready for development. The team should work through the items in priority making sure that if there is already an estimate the team still agrees with the estimate. Finally, the team should estimate how many points the team can deliver in the sprint and then make a commitment for the sprint. During the sprint, the team takes the highest priority items off of the backlog and works on them to completion. At the end of the sprint, the team reports the number of story points completed during the sprint. The agile coordinator should track this information so that over time, the team can work to get better at estimating the points that each story requires as well as how many points can be delivered in a given sprint.","title":"Estimation in Planning"},{"location":"best-practices/continuous-planning/agile-development/sprint-planning/estimation.html#relative-mass","text":"If there are a lot of stories to be estimated, the team can be overwhelmed doing this all at once, and the process can be long and unproductive. However, because the stories are estimated relative to each other, it may be easier to do a relative mass estimation. For each story, either a card or a sticky note is created. The first card is read and then placed in the center of the table or board. Then, as each card is read, the team asks \"Is this easier or harder that that card?\", and it is placed in either lower or higher position than the story that already exist on the table. This continues with each card being placed in a line of difficulty from easiest to most difficult until all stories are placed.

For these projects, as with all projects, we follow the general guidelines laid out in other sections around security, testing, observability, CI/CD etc. Goal \u00b6 The goal of this section is to briefly describe how to apply the fundamentals to data heavy projects or portions of the project. Isolation \u00b6 Please be cautious of which isolation levels you are using. Even with a database that offers serializability, it is possible that within a transaction or connection you are leveraging a lower isolation level than the database offers. In particular, read uncommitted (or eventual consistency), can have a lot of unpredictable side effects and introduce bugs that are difficult to reason about. Eventually consistent systems should be treated as a last resort for achieving your scalability requirements; batching, sharding, and caching are all recommended solutions to increase your scalability. If none of these options are tenable, consider evaluating the \"New SQL\" databases like CockroachDB or TiDB, before leveraging an option that relies on eventual consistency. There are other levels of isolation, outside the isolation levels mentioned in the link above. Some of these have nuances different from the 4 main levels, and can be difficult to compare. Snapshot Isolation, strict serializability, \"read your own writes\", monotonic reads, bounded staleness, causal consistency, and linearizability are all other terms you can look into to learn more on the subject. Concurrency Control \u00b6 Your systems should (almost) always leverage some form of concurrency control, to ensure correctness amongst competing requests and to prevent data races. The 2 forms of concurrency control are pessimistic and optimistic . A pessimistic transaction involves a first request to \"lock the data\", and a second request to write the data. In between these requests, no other requests touching that data will succeed. See 2 Phase Locking (also often known as 2 Phase Commit) for more info. The (more) recommended approach is optimistic concurrency, where a user can read the object at a specific version, and update the object if and only if it hasn't changed. This is typically done via the Etag Header . A simple way to accomplish this on the database side is to increment a version number on each update. This can be done in a single executed statement as: WARNING: the below will not work when using an isolation level at or lower than read uncommitted (eventual consistency). -- Please treat this as pseudo code, and adjust as necessary. UPDATE <table_name> SET field1 = value1, ..., fieldN = valueN, version = $new_version WHERE ID = $id AND version = $version Data Tiering (Data Quality) \u00b6 Develop a common understanding of the quality of your datasets so that everyone understands the quality of the data, and expected use cases and limitations. A common data quality model is Bronze , Silver , Gold Bronze: This is a landing area for your raw datasets with none or minimal data transformations applied, and therefore are optimized for writes / ingestion. Treat these datasets as an immutable, append only store. Silver: These are cleansed, semi-processed datasets. These conform to a known schema and predefined data invariants and might have further data augmentation applied. These are typically used by data scientists. Gold: These are highly processed, highly read-optimized datasets primarily for consumption of business users. Typically, these are structured in your standard fact and dimension tables. Divide your data lake into three major areas containing your Bronze, Silver and Gold datasets. Note: Additional storage areas for malformed data, intermediate (sandbox) data, and libraries/packages/binaries are also useful when designing your storage organization. Data Validation \u00b6 Validate data early in your pipeline Add data validation between the Bronze and Silver datasets. By validating early in your pipeline, you can ensure all datasets conform to a specific schema and known data invariants. This can also potentially prevent data pipeline failures in case of unexpected changes to the input data. Data that does not pass this validation stage can be rerouted to a record store dedicated for malformed data for diagnostic purposes. It may be tempting to add validation prior to landing in the Bronze area of your data lake. This is generally not recommended. Bronze datasets are there to ensure you have as close of a copy of the source system data. This can be used to replay the data pipeline for both testing (i.e. testing data validation logic) and data recovery purposes (i.e. data corruption is introduced due to a bug in the data transformation code and thus the pipeline needs to be replayed). Idempotent Data Pipelines \u00b6 Make your data pipelines re-playable and idempotent Silver and Gold datasets can get corrupted due to a number of reasons such as unintended bugs, unexpected input data changes, and more. By making data pipelines re-playable and idempotent, you can recover from this state through deployment of code fixes, and re-playing the data pipelines. Idempotency also ensures data-duplication is mitigated when replaying your data pipelines. Testing \u00b6 Ensure data transformation code is testable Abstracting away data transformation code from data access code is key to ensuring unit tests can be written against data transformation logic. An example of this is moving transformation code from notebooks into packages. While it is possible to run tests against notebooks, by extracting the code into packages, you increase the developer productivity by increasing the speed of the feedback cycle. CI/CD, Source Control and Code Reviews \u00b6 All artifacts needed to build the data pipeline from scratch should be in source control. This included infrastructure-as-code artifacts, database objects (schema definitions, functions, stored procedures etc.), reference/application data, data pipeline definitions and data validation and transformation logic. Any new artifacts (code) introduced to the repository should be code reviewed, both automatically (linting, credential scanning etc.) and peer reviewed. There should be a safe, repeatable process (CI/CD) to move the changes through dev, test and finally production. Security and Configuration \u00b6 Maintain a central, secure location for sensitive configuration such as database connection strings that can be accessed by the appropriate services within the specific environment. On Azure this is typically solved through securing secrets in a Key Vault per environment, then having the relevant services query KeyVault for the configuration Observability \u00b6 Monitor infrastructure, pipelines and data A proper monitoring solution should be in-place to ensure failures are identified, diagnosed and addressed in a timely manner. Aside from the base infrastructure and pipeline runs, data should also be monitored. A common area that should have data monitoring is the malformed record store.

Even with a database that offers serializability, it is possible that within a transaction or connection you are leveraging a lower isolation level than the database offers. In particular, read uncommitted (or eventual consistency), can have a lot of unpredictable side effects and introduce bugs that are difficult to reason about. Eventually consistent systems should be treated as a last resort for achieving your scalability requirements; batching, sharding, and caching are all recommended solutions to increase your scalability. If none of these options are tenable, consider evaluating the \"New SQL\" databases like CockroachDB or TiDB, before leveraging an option that relies on eventual consistency. There are other levels of isolation, outside the isolation levels mentioned in the link above. Some of these have nuances different from the 4 main levels, and can be difficult to compare. Snapshot Isolation, strict serializability, \"read your own writes\", monotonic reads, bounded staleness, causal consistency, and linearizability are all other terms you can look into to learn more on the subject.","title":"Isolation"},{"location":"best-practices/continuous-planning/design-reviews/design-patterns/data-heavy-design-guidance.html#concurrency-control","text":"Your systems should (almost) always leverage some form of concurrency control, to ensure correctness amongst competing requests and to prevent data races. The 2 forms of concurrency control are pessimistic and optimistic . A pessimistic transaction involves a first request to \"lock the data\", and a second request to write the data. In between these requests, no other requests touching that data will succeed. See 2 Phase Locking (also often known as 2 Phase Commit) for more info. The (more) recommended approach is optimistic concurrency, where a user can read the object at a specific version, and update the object if and only if it hasn't changed. This is typically done via the Etag Header . A simple way to accomplish this on the database side is to increment a version number on each update. This can be done in a single executed statement as: WARNING: the below will not work when using an isolation level at or lower than read uncommitted (eventual consistency). -- Please treat this as pseudo code, and adjust as necessary.

Highlight common design decisions and factors to consider when designing. Provide additional resources to inform API design in areas not directly addressed by the Microsoft guidelines. Common API Design Decisions \u00b6 The Microsoft REST API guidelines provide design guidance covering a multitude of use-cases. The following sections are a good place to start as they are likely required considerations by any REST API design: URL Structure HTTP Methods HTTP Status Codes Collections JSON Standardizations Versioning Naming Creating API Contracts \u00b6 As different development teams expose APIs to access various REST based services, it's important to have an API contract to share between the producer and consumers of APIs. Open API format is one of the most popular API description format. This Open API document can be produced in two ways: Design-First - Team starts developing APIs by first describing API designs as an Open API document and later generates server side boilerplate code with the help of this document. Code-First - Team starts writing the server side API interface code e.g. controllers, DTOs etc. and later generates and Open API document from it. Design-First Approach \u00b6 A Design-First approach means that APIs are treated as \"first-class citizens\" and everything about a project revolves around the idea that at the end these APIs will be consumed by clients. So based on the business requirements API development team first start describing API designs as an Open API document and collaborate with the stakeholders to gather feedback. This approach is quite useful if a project is about developing externally exposed set of APIs which will be consumed by partners. In this approach, we first agree upon an API contract (Open API document) creating clear expectations on both API producer and consumer sides so both teams can begin work in parallel as per the pre-agreed API design. Key Benefits of this approach: Early API design feedback. Clearly established expectations for both consumer & producer as both have agreed upon an API contract. Development teams can work in parallel. Testing team can use API contracts to write early tests even before business logic is in place. By looking at different models, paths, attributes and other aspects of the API testing can provide their input which can be very valuable. During an agile development cycle API definitions are not impacted by incremental dev changes. API design is not influenced by actual implementation limitations & code structure. Server side boilerplate code e.g. controllers, DTOs etc. can be auto generated from API contracts. May improve collaboration between API producer & consumer teams. Planning a Design-First Development: Identify use cases & key services which API should offer. Identify key stakeholders of API and try to include them during API design phase to get continuous feedback. Write API contract definitions. Maintain consistent style for API status codes, versioning, error responses etc. Encourage peer reviews via pull requests. Generate server side boilerplate code & client SDKs from API contract definitions. Important Points to consider: If API requirements changes often during initial development phase, than a Design-First approach may not be a good fit as this will introduce additional overhead, requiring repeated updates & maintenance to the API contract definitions. It might be worthwhile to first try out your platform specific code generator and evaluate how much more additional work will be required in order to meet your project requirements and coding guidelines because it is possible that a particular platform specific code generator might not be able to generate a flexible & maintainable implementation of actual code. For instance If your web framework requires annotations to be present on your controller classes (e.g. for API versioning or authentication), make sure that the code generation tool you use fully supports them. Code-First Approach \u00b6 A Code-First approach means that development teams first implements server side API interface code e.g. controllers, DTOs etc. and than generates API contract definitions out of it. In current times this approach is more widely popular within developer community than Design-First Approach. This approach has the advantages of allowing the team to quickly implement APIs and also providing the flexibility to react very quickly to any unexpected API requirement changes. Key Benefits of this approach: Rapid development of APIs as development team can start implementing APIs much faster directly after understanding key requirements & use cases. Development team has better control & flexibility to implement server side API interfaces in a way which best suited for project structure. More popular among development teams so its easier to get consensus on a related topic and also has more ready to use code examples available on various blogs or developer forums regarding how to generate Open API definitions out of actual code. During initial phase of development where both API producer & consumers requirements might change often this approach is better as it provides flexibility to quickly react on such changes. Important Points to consider: A generated Open API definition can become outdated, so its important to have automated checks to avoid this otherwise generated client SDKs will be out of sync and may cause issues for API consumers. With Agile development, it is hard to ensure that definitions embedded in runtime code remain stable, especially across rounds of refactoring and when serving multiple concurrent API versions. It might be useful to regularly generate Open API definition and store it in version control system otherwise generating the OpenAPI definition at runtime might makes it more complex in scenarios where that definition is required at development/CI time. How to Interpret and Apply The Guidelines \u00b6 The API guidelines document includes a section on how to apply the guidelines depending on whether the API is new or existing. In particular, when working in an existing API ecosystem, be sure to align with stakeholders on a definition of what constitutes a breaking change to understand the impact of implementing certain best practices. We do not recommend making a breaking change to a service that predates these guidelines simply for the sake of compliance.

Site Reliability Engineers are development-focused engineers who solve operational/scale/reliability problems. Software is certainly eating the world, and as our dependence on technology increases, disciplines have arisen to ensure that changes are rolled out efficiently and our systems are there when we need them. The rise of DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering cultures and practices has risen to the mainstream over the past years. Being a DevOps Engineer or SRE are certainly in-demand job titles and skillsets to have. Not to fall into the eponym of \u201cCI/CD\u201d while saying \u201cDevOps/SRE,\u201d understanding the overlap and differences between the two skillsets and organizations is important. Both solve very distinct challenges with unique and innovative approaches, ushering in new paradigms in technology. What Are the Differences Between SREs and DevOps? \u00b6 Having more efficient and reliable systems are not new goals in technology. Like many other facets of technology, the learnings and science behind both goals have increased to warrant specialized organizations and engineers. The DevOps movement is all about breaking down silos. The quintessential disconnect of the development team and operations team is exactly what DevOps Engineers and leaders are trying to solve. This divide makes sense, as those who write software were typically not those who run the software. Years of these practices take time to untangle in organizations and changing mindsets are hard to forecast. Having reliable systems at scale is a complex problem to solve. As systems become more distributed in nature, ensuring reliability or the appearance of reliability across the vast topology of moving parts is challenging. Internal and external customers alike expect systems to be available all the time, and even a brief outage (downtime) or reduction in uptime can be detrimental to a firm\u2019s reputation and bottom line. In a nutshell, DevOps Engineers are ops-focused engineers who solve development pipeline problems. Site Reliability Engineers are development-focused engineers who solve operational/scale/reliability problems. Both sets of engineers are crossing the chasm by bringing their expertise and opinions to the other side of the equation. Though, we are human and fallible, and subject to Conway\u2019s Law. Conway\u2019s Law At Play \u00b6 A popular organizational item to talk about in DevOps culture is Conway\u2019s Law . If you are unfamiliar with Conway\u2019s Law, it is an adage stating that organizations design systems which mirror their own communication structure. We are people, and us as people, design systems. Looking at DevOps team structures, DevOps teams are focused on breaking down organizational silos that were created by Conway\u2019s Law and creating a cultural shift toward collaboration and communication. These silos that are institutional are barriers in engineering efficiency; two or more sets of people to get features across the line and be operational with separate goals. Reading one of the quintessential DevOps pieces, Gene Kim\u2019s The Phoenix Project , illustrates how problems can be tossed across the proverbial wall. The adage that reliability is everyone\u2019s responsibility is true, but the core of innovation work is that we are trying things for the first time. Where DevOps focuses more on the merging and removal of the silos, Site Reliability Engineering focuses on the craft of reliability. Reading one of the quintessential SRE pieces, Google\u2019s SRE Book , there is more of a focus on approach and respecting the complexity for operating systems at scale. Because we are all still fighting Conway\u2019s Law, having a solid DevOps team does not mean you have site reliability down. The vice versa is true: just because you have site reliability down doesn\u2019t mean that you have engineering efficiency that a DevOps investment brings. They are solving for two different domains. Two Different Problem Sets \u00b6 Engineering efficiency and reliability are two separate domains, but have some overlap. There is a correlation between agility and more robust systems. A counter-argument might be made that agility brings about a fast velocity of change, and change is a detriment to reliability. Today\u2019s challenges are faced at scale, and as we continue to push the boundaries, adjusting on-the-fly is important. The problems that both teams solve are telling to the culture and skills needed for both to thrive. What Problems Do DevOps Teams Solve? \u00b6 Engineering efficiency can have a wide paintbrush. If you take a look at certain DevOps job postings, it can sound like the job poster is looking for an entire IT organization in one person . The SDLC (software delivery life cycle) can be a windy road to traverse. DevOps teams strive to remove bottlenecks across the entire SDLC by removing barriers to production and automation. With the adoption of Agile, production changes are being created and needing to be deployed at a faster velocity, as incremental changes are now the expectation. The DevOps teams are purveyors of development tools, from providing guidance at the inception of the SDLC with source code management (SCM) recommendations to enabling Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery in an organization. With a wide gamut of responsibilities, DevOps teams can have ownership and oversight over a number of tools and platforms. SREs, on the other hand, focus on system health. Lastly, it\u2019s important to note the DevOps pillars as these can offer more detail into what DevOps teams solve for. What Problems Do SREs Solve? \u00b6 Site Reliability Engineering teams focus on safety, health, uptime, and the ability to remedy unforeseen problems. A romanticized idea is that SREs are only sprung into action during an incident, helping devise remedies for problems until the engineering teams can make proper remediation. Certainly, an important pillar of the job is combating incidents, and SREs spend a good deal of time making sure the firefight doesn\u2019t occur with their vast expertise. By removing some of the complex burdens in how to scale and maintain uptime in distributed systems, SRE practices allow development teams to focus on feature development instead of the nuances of achieving and maintaining service level commitments. SLAs, SLOs, and SLIs \u00b6 Both DevOps and SRE teams value metrics, as you can\u2019t improve on what you can\u2019t measure. Indicators and measurements of how well a system is performing can be represented by one of the Service Level (SLx) commitments. There is a trio of metrics, SLAs, SLOs, and SLIs, that paint a picture of the agreement made vs the objectives and actuals to meet the agreement. With SLOs and SLIs, you can garner insight into the health of a system. SLAs \u00b6 Service Level Agreements are the commitment/agreement you make with your customers. Your customers might be internal, external, or another system. SLAs are usually crafted around customer expectations or system expectations. SLAs have been around for some time, and most engineers would consider an SLA to be \u201cwe need to reply in 2000ms or less,\u201d which in today\u2019s nomenclature would actually be an SLO. An SLA, in that case, would be \u201cwe require 99% uptime.\u201d SLOs \u00b6 Service Level Objectives are goals that need to be met in order to meet SLAs. Looking at Tom Wilkie\u2019s RED method can help you come up with good metrics for SLOs: requests, errors, and duration. In the above example of \u201cwe need to reply in 2000ms or less 99% of the time,\u201d that would fall under duration, or the amount of time it takes to complete a request in your system. Google\u2019s Four Golden Signals are also great metrics to have as SLOs, but also includes saturation. Measuring SLOs is the purpose of SLIs. SLIs \u00b6 Service Level Indicators measure compliance/conformance with an SLO. Harping on the \u201cwe need to reply in 2000ms or less 99% of the time\u201d SLO from above, the SLI would be the actual measurement. Maybe 98% of requests have a reply in less than 2000ms, which is not up to the goal of the SLO. If SLOs/SLIs are being broken, time should be spent to remedy/fix issues related to the slowdowns For DevOps teams, system health and availability does not mean engineering efficiency is being met. Another set of metrics to look at for DevOps teams are the Accelerate metrics. Accelerate Metrics for DevOps Teams \u00b6 You can have the most resilient and robust system in the world, but if your customers are not completing their journeys, adoption and success will be hard to attain. In Accelerate , a book by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim, we dig into the organizational science of high-performing technology teams. The authors recommended measuring software delivery performance into four key metrics. Lead Time, Deployment Frequency, Mean Time to Restore (MTTR), and Change Failure Percentage. Lead Time \u00b6 In lean manufacturing, the lead time is the amount of time it takes from a customer request to the fulfillment of that request. In the technology domain, this can be the time from when code is checked in to when the code is deployed into production. Deployment Frequency \u00b6 The number of times that deployments to production occur in an amount of time. Are you deploying to production every day, week, month, year? The more frequently your internal customers can deploy, certainly the more efficient the software delivery process is. Mean Time To Restore \u00b6 Taking another page from lean manufacturing, MTTR is an incident metric that calculates an average time to restore a system. In the software sense, restoring is rolling back to the last known version of the application. Mean Time to Repair is when the repairing starts, e.g the start of the rollback. The \u201crestore\u201d portion of Mean Time to Restore is when the system is back to its previous functionality. Change Failure Percentage \u00b6 This represents the percentage of changes in production that fail. After navigating all of the confidence-building exercises leading up to production, with the number of unknowns in production, a change will fail. Lowering the change failure rate allows for more confidence in production. In modern delivery methods, failing more often early (in a lower environment) is key vs failing in production. Harness has the ability out of the box to visualize Accelerate metrics, allowing for this data to be shared, thus enabling collaboration across the enterprise. When comparing concerns of DevOps teams vs SRE teams, we can see where the overlap and differences appear further. DevOps vs SRE Concern Table Comparing different DevOps concerns vs SRE concerns. Concern DevOps SRE When asked 'What Do You Do Around Here?\" Mange the Development pipeline Resilience, scaling, uptime, robustness TL;DR A System engineer, who primarily focuses on development problems. A Software engineer, focusing on operational problems. Does the Application Cluster? Yes, the application does. We need three nodes. We use a RAFT-based leader-elected clustering mechanism focused on Apache Zookeeper. We front the application with Apache Mesos to work through Dominant Resource Fairness constraints. Can We Have Monitoring? Yes, we use Prometheus, ELK, and FluentD and can provide hooks into each. Concerned about the science around how the monitoring tool works. Black box vs white box monitoring and specific metrics about each. Advising teams on pros/cons. Our Deployment Failed. The pipelines we created allow you to re-run. If additional debugging is needed, we can connect the dots with log/trace systems. Unless it caused an outage, we wouldn\u2019t get involved to help with the remedy. If the deployment regularly fails, we can work to help decipher why. Typical Metrics Deployment frequency, deployment failure rate. Error budgets, SLOs, SLIs, Four Golden Signals War Chant \u201cPeople, Process, Technology & Automation!\u201d \u201cThere is no root cause!\u201d The level of detail that SREs take a look at are more tool-agnostic and approach-centric vs DevOps teams providing tools and pipelines for engineering organizations to further the mission. Both skillsets and teams are certainly important in any modern organization. SRE and DevOps, Better Together \u00b6 Both can be viewed as leveraged resources; clearly, there is not a 1:1 ratio of a Software Engineer to DevOps Engineers (though it can feel like it as organizations try to scale) or Site Reliability Engineers. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Building Secure and Reliable Systems, when compared to the first rendition of Google\u2019s SRE Book, discusses team structure poisoning SREs as advisors/experts. Building software at scale requires specialized engineers to help tackle problems and further capabilities. DevOps Engineers, SREs, and other engineers such as Application Security Engineers fall into the category of specialized advisors. Google, in its SRE Book, described all the expertise across multiple domains needed to launch and maintain a product like Gmail, which surprised even me. Harness is here to enable and partner with engineering organizations.

Lastly, it\u2019s important to note the DevOps pillars as these can offer more detail into what DevOps teams solve for.","title":"What Problems Do DevOps Teams Solve?"},{"location":"the-basics/devops-vs-sre.html#what-problems-do-sres-solve","text":"Site Reliability Engineering teams focus on safety, health, uptime, and the ability to remedy unforeseen problems. A romanticized idea is that SREs are only sprung into action during an incident, helping devise remedies for problems until the engineering teams can make proper remediation. Certainly, an important pillar of the job is combating incidents, and SREs spend a good deal of time making sure the firefight doesn\u2019t occur with their vast expertise. By removing some of the complex burdens in how to scale and maintain uptime in distributed systems, SRE practices allow development teams to focus on feature development instead of the nuances of achieving and maintaining service level commitments.","title":"What Problems Do SREs Solve?"},{"location":"the-basics/devops-vs-sre.html#slas-slos-and-slis","text":"Both DevOps and SRE teams value metrics, as you can\u2019t improve on what you can\u2019t measure. Indicators and measurements of how well a system is performing can be represented by one of the Service Level (SLx) commitments. There is a trio of metrics, SLAs, SLOs, and SLIs, that paint a picture of the agreement made vs the objectives and actuals to meet the agreement. With SLOs and SLIs, you can garner insight into the health of a system.","title":"SLAs, SLOs, and SLIs"},{"location":"the-basics/devops-vs-sre.html#slas","text":"Service Level Agreements are the commitment/agreement you make with your customers.

A Software engineer, focusing on operational problems. Does the Application Cluster? Yes, the application does. We need three nodes. We use a RAFT-based leader-elected clustering mechanism focused on Apache Zookeeper. We front the application with Apache Mesos to work through Dominant Resource Fairness constraints. Can We Have Monitoring? Yes, we use Prometheus, ELK, and FluentD and can provide hooks into each. Concerned about the science around how the monitoring tool works. Black box vs white box monitoring and specific metrics about each. Advising teams on pros/cons. Our Deployment Failed. The pipelines we created allow you to re-run.

At its simplest, DevOps is about removing the barriers between two traditionally siloed teams, development and operations. In some organizations, there may not even be separate development and operations teams; engineers may do both. With DevOps, the two teams work together to optimize both the productivity of developers and the reliability of operations. They strive to communicate frequently, increase efficiencies, and improve the quality of services they provide to customers. They take full ownership for their services, often beyond where their stated roles or titles have traditionally been scoped by thinking about the end customer\u2019s needs and how they can contribute to solving those needs. Quality assurance and security teams may also become tightly integrated with these teams. Organizations using a DevOps model, regardless of their organizational structure, have teams that view the entire development and infrastructure lifecycle as part of their responsibilities. DevOps Practices Explained \u00b6 There are a few key practices that help organizations innovate faster through automating and streamlining the software development and infrastructure management processes. Most of these practices are accomplished with proper tooling. One fundamental practice is to perform very frequent but small updates. This is how organizations innovate faster for their customers. These updates are usually more incremental in nature than the occasional updates performed under traditional release practices. Frequent but small updates make each deployment less risky. They help teams address bugs faster because teams can identify the last deployment that caused the error. Although the cadence and size of updates will vary, organizations using a DevOps model deploy updates much more often than organizations using traditional software development practices. Organizations might also use a 'cloud-native' architecture to make their applications more flexible and enable quicker innovation. The cloud-native (aka micro-services) architecture decouples large, complex systems into simple, independent projects. Applications are broken into many individual components (services) with each service scoped to a single purpose or function and operated independently of its peer services and the application as a whole. This architecture reduces the coordination overhead of updating applications, and when each service is paired with small, agile teams who take ownership of each service, organizations can move more quickly. However, the combination of micro-services and increased release frequency leads to significantly more deployments which can present operational challenges. Thus, DevOps practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery solve these issues and let organizations deliver rapidly in a safe and reliable manner. Infrastructure automation practices, like infrastructure as code and configuration management, help to keep computing resources elastic and responsive to frequent changes. In addition, the use of monitoring and logging helps engineers track the performance of applications and infrastructure so they can react quickly to problems. Together, these practices help organizations deliver faster, more reliable updates to their customers. Here is an overview of important DevOps practices.
